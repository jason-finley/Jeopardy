Passion Project

Run gameboard.py to create jeopardy style board GUI. This Board takes questions from questions.json file.
Both text and image can be displayed on question and answer page.

Run main.py to create a webpage that allows a user to host a LAN lobby allowing users to "buzz in" for questions on their phones. Buzzes are then sent and displayed on the hosts phone in chronological order.
